The project has been developed as it can compensate when some invalid values entered by the user.
So, some rules have been assigned:

2) Char or String values can consist of both upper and lower case letters
3) Users can enter 

Field Size:
1) Field size must consist of 2 values(X and Y coordinate)
2) Values must be integers

Initial Position:
1) Initial Position must consist of 3 values (X coordinate, Y coordinate, Facing Direction)
2) First 2 values must be integers and last value must be a char value that matches with a direction type

Command List:
1) Commands must be given as adjacent char values.
2) Command List must not include any unstated command letter
3) Users must create new command lists unless the one they entered makes rovers go out of defined boundaries


You can contact me any time if you have a question about the project.
Sincerely
